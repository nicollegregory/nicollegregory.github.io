         <p>Was never a fan of hip hop until middle school, even though i would still say my knowledge on hip hop is trash (need recommendations!!). I think the reason I was so hesitant with hip hop at a younger age was because, music for me, was mostly in the instrumental and how the song actually sounded? Hip hop for me was just words with no significance for me, or i Honestly could not understand what was being said half the time. Now that my frontal lobe has developed a bit, I have a greater appreciation for lyrics and would consider rappers poets (those that write their own raps of course.) One of the downsides to this song is the fact that is 2 MINUTES??? Illegal. Get it out of mud face. There’s so much texture in this track with headphones on. Specifically, SONY headphones (not sponsored).

       <p>Noise cancelling headphones are life changing? I was a huge wires fan, especially when AirPods came out. Not the biggest fans of AirPods, BUT I love them for school. In high school, I would have to tuck the wire under my clothes considering music was not allowed, This was not me rebelling, it was me just trying to pay attention in class. High school courses specifically were boring as hell and I could not help but daze off half the time. Music helped keep a part of my brain occupied/ stimulated, good for a short attention span. Now I listen to music in class with ease (even though art professors are chill and for the most part do not care. Not sure if AirPods are meant to mold into your ear shape? It has not done conformed to my ear so they are constantly slipping out or wedging in an uncomfortable position in my ear. Hence by I prefer my SONY wireless headphones, plus they look fashionable.

       <p>I have a secret to reveal to the audience… I use to have a fan account. LOLL, this must never be discussed after your viewing of this page! This secret is now shared with he reals ones that made it this far into the entries and have read my endless list of rambles. Now why do I bring up such an embarrassing fact? This songs takes me back to this time of my life (it is also a really cool side alongside any other Freddie Dread song). Not to toot my own horn, or give much away, but my middle school hustle was kind of insane. Not sure how I juggled between school and uploading multiple times a week. i remember dedicating hours to this page and making it feel like a job.

       <p> I do always wonder how far I could have gotten with it. To add on, I wish it was not such an embarrassing time (insert the school emoji).The digital content i was producing using after effects at 14 was quite impressive, and sadly I have lost my proficient in AE, but hope to get into again. The emotion embarrassment has been ruining my life thus far. If it weren’t for such an intense emotion, I would gave already been proudly showing my work. Sadly, I am still working on being more out going and giving less shits about what other people have to say. A process, but I am getting there! Being shy robs your from opportunities…. clock it.  </p>

        <p>I remember being amused by the music video when i was younger, as well as the voices. The light and feathery vocals contrasting the chorus that embodies punk. Through a cinematographer stance, the coloring on the video is giving twilight. So moody and fitting for the meaning of the song. People using music as a cry for s help or to address the horrors of society are so powerful. The two girls can be seen behind this fence, in a homosexual relationship, being judged by the crowd.  It is later revealed that the ones being true to themselves are free while those that are close minded are truly the ones locked up behind the bars of curiosity and freedom, judging everyone else on their decisions.

       <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> This is something I feel passionately about actually. Not sure why people do not know how to mind their own business or be open minded. It sound miserable actually to constantly be a hater. I have my fair share of opinions, but at the end of the day, who cares? If we look at it through a political lens, abortion for example,  how are you going to tell someone on the other side of the country that they cannot make a decision about their own body because it does not align with your OWN personal beliefs.  I truly could go on and on but I am not politician and NO ONE CARES, I certainly do not (about my own opinion).

The scream at the beginning of the song gets me every time. Moody songs like this are so impactful, especially when you are able to attain this trait with your voice are a few chords. Emo trap like this is really tickles my brain. Can we talk about how wearing the color black with some eyeliner doesn’t make you emo? I feel like that’s offensive to the actual aesthetics of a cool, emo, chick. High school specifically was a time where the word emo had been used to describe me left and right. Was it the liner, the nose piercing, or the fact that I didn’t dress in leggings and sweatshirt everyday. I cannot help that black matches everything, and its a color that looks good on me :)

       </div>
       <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> It is sad to see artists that produce heavy content, blatantly, be consumed by the horror of fame. Lil peeps drug overdose, amongst many other celebrity deaths are ultimately the results of being in this spotlight.  Why don’t people view one another as human beings through and through. The argument of “they chose this life” always makes my eye twitch. People are choosing their passion, not a death sentence or and invitation to their privacy.

             <p>Let’s start off my dismissing the name LOLLL. This song is so good but I am always so hesitant to cue it in front of my mother. One time I remember posting this song on my Instagram story and my mom swiped up with he infamous “???”. Why is that I am overthinking what to post on MY feed. I propose posting a song because of the vibes and sound, not always the lyrics. I catch myself. hyper fixating on the lyrics when I post to ensure no one gets the wrong idea (even though in reality, NO ONE CARES!!) That aside, I can’t help but get pumped when this song comes up. It has this ragged sound to it with the guitar.

       <p> Does anyone else get crazy anxiety on aux? I love being given the opportunity to play what I like, but I cannot help overthinking the shit out of my decisions, and end up playing songs that i think person b would enjoy. This stems from my fear of making someone uncomfortable or seeing that someone is not having a good time because of me.Music is meant to be shared amongst people, almost an insight into their personalities and likings. It could be a form of bonding as well!
