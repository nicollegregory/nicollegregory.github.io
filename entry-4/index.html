      <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>This weeks theme was <span id="white">space</span>. As someone who loves to create playlists based off a preferred "vibe",  <span id="white">spcae</span> is one of my favorites. Usually during night rides or when the I need audio stimulation to tickle my brain. Traveling overseas these past two weeks inspired me to have my  <span id="white">space</span> playlist on loop. Especially with flights ranging from 10-20 hours (yikes!!).</p>
      <h2 class="hover-tr">Song 1: Heaven</h2>  
        <p>The neighbor never misses with their instrumentals. Aside from Jesse Rutherford's insane vocals, the music alone is very effective and almost emotionl? Their music carries this nostalgia and celestail feel to it. </p>
        <p> Retro and technial influences are common in their tracks. This feature really sets off the dream effect that disorts you into a different universe (dramatic but true). I would say the NBHD dominates my <span id="white">space</span> playlist.</p>
     
        <h2 class="hover-tr">Song 2: After Dark</h2>
        <p> Cannot remember the first time I found this song, but the feeling it gives me is consistent even years later. The piano and rain ambiance almost places you, as a listener, into the song. It is a bit on the darker side mood wise, but still such an interesting sound.</p>

      <h2 class="hover-tr">Song 3: Im God</h2>
        <p> Anotheer song that heavily relies on instrumentals. The distorted vocals are almost the siren call vibe, very alluring. Sumblimiinal almost. The voicee is unique and airy. The whispers with headphones is the cherry on top. 
        <p>I feel like blasting music in a car and blastiing them in headphones are very different. You physically feel it in a car. The wind in your hair, taking in the scenery with the music ringing in your ears. As a melomaniac, I cannot blast music outload everytime, but I have grown a deep value for my headphones. An item I could not live with out and you will always find on me. Headphones feel a lot more personal.</p>

      <h2 class="hover-tr">Song 4: Like Crazy</h2>
            <p> I have a lot to say about this song, but I must stay on track. The lyrics paired with Jimins voice makes the song all more emotional. His voice is so light throughout the song, and then youre struck with this power in the outro. Whispers in the intro and outro pull you into the song. This club-like song, making you want to yell the lyrics at the top of your lungs. The song feels very trendy and makes you want to move. </p>
            <p> "Now dont you wake me, I wanna stay in this dream. Dont save me, dont you try to save me. I need a way we, I need a way we can dream on." One of my favorite lyrics to exist.</p>
      <h2 class="hover-tr">Song 5: Dreams</h2>
            <p> In general, Bazzi's Cosmic album screams <span id="white">space</span>. Just by looking at the cover art and track titles, you can already sense the vibe. This was an album I frequently listened to in middle school, so I guess I have always been attracted to this kind of vibe. Dreams specifically starts of strong with the lyrics "A place, where space and time doesnt exist...just us". So simply, yet a great intro. There is this run of an instrument throughout the song paired with a bass guitar that I really enjoy, very playful.</p>
