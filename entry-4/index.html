         <p>This weeks theme was space. As someone who loves to create playlists based off a preferred "vibe", space is one of my favorites. Usually during night rides or when I need audio stimulation to tickle my brain. Traveling overseas these past two weeks inspired me to have my space playlist on loop. Especially with flights ranging from 10-20 hours (yikes!!).

         <p>The Neighbourhood NEVER misses.  I would say the NBHD dominates my space playlist.Their music revolves around themes of relationships and reflection of oneself that can be considered relatable to many listeners. I would describe their content as “heavy”, with lyrics containing dark themes that are sung with so much emotion, hence my attraction to their music. Aside from Jesse Rutherford's insane vocals, the instrumentals hold their own weight, this track specifically. Their music carries this nostalgic, celestial feel to it. </p>
   </div>
      <div class="paragraph2">
       <p>I would almost consider it trippy? (iykyk) Retro and technical influences are common in their tracks. This feature really set off the dream effect that distorts you into a different universe (dramatic but true). Do I sell my house to see them in concert?? Honestly yes. There are a handful of artists that I would drop mad money on and the Neighbourhood is one of them. I need to see more than the typical setlist length though.

       <p> Cannot remember the first time I found this song, but the feeling it gives me is consistent even years later. I LOVE when music does that. I might not be looping it anymore, but it still hits the way it did on first listen. You ever wish you could listen to a song again for the first time? Though the feeling is similar, it’s not same (insert sad face). I feel that way about shows too. Rewatching shows doesn’t bother me all that much considering my memory is trash and i tend to forget the plot within a year or so. 
 </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> Back to the song, the piano and rain ambiance almost places you, as a listener, into the song. Now thinking about it, this song in 8D would be fire. A personal concert experience where it feels like the artist is waking around you with a microphone in hand, how cool. It is a bit on the darker side mood wise, but still such an interesting sound. The voice is also unique, deep and techno. 2:20 brings you back from this high that was the chorus and revs you up for the ending of the song. Especially with the voices whispering in my ear??? Out of context I sound insane lol. </p>

        <p>Another song that heavily relies on instrumentals. The distorted vocals are almost the siren call vibe, very alluring. Subliminal almost. The voice is unique and airy. The whispers with headphones is the cherry on top. ANDDDD it is almost 5 minutes long, we love to see it :P I was going to type something but then I deleted it but I think I will type it anyways cause these are my true thoughts and the entire point of these entries. Now imagine listening to this on hard drugs… LMAOO i’m kidding that’s cray z…but it feels fitting lol.

       <p> I feel like blasting music in a car and blasting them in headphones are very different. You physically feel it in a car. The wind in your hair, taking in the scenery with the music ringing in your ears. Did you know there is a setting int he car to amp up the bass??? I can’t drive and know nothing about cars my f bad if this is a known thing, idc :[ When you turn it up a notch, you can REALLY feel the music lol. As a melo-maniac, I cannot blast music out load every time obviiii, but I have grown a deep value for my headphones. An item I could not live with out and you will always find on me. Headphones feel a lot more personal to be honest.

I have a lot to say about this song, but I must stay on track. I will start off by saying: MY MANS MY MANS MY MANS. My celebrity crush? Park Jimin fr fr, loml.  I remember being absolutely gagged by this song when it first came out. I was ready to support the man regardless of how good it really was LOL. But it was actually really fire and life changing. The lyrics written by the man himself paired with his light voice throughout the song, and then you’re struck with this power in the outro. Whispers in the intro and outro pull you into the song. This club-like song, making you want to yell the lyrics at the top of your lungs. I truly believe this song could have done number with the public. Well it did, but the general public.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> "Now don’t you wake me, I wanna stay in this dream. Don’t save me, don’t you try to save me. I need a way we, I need a way we can dream on." One of my favorite lyrics to exist. Do i get it tattooed on my thighs??? Ive been thinking about it. I want a thigh tattoo for sure and lyrics seem fitting. And these so happen to be some of my fave bars as of right now. Well favorite since it came out. This song definitely has an effect on me every time it comes up? The first second of the song and I am already summoned. I would pay MONEY to just see this one song (would prefer to see him in concert front row, with him singing every song he has every sung).!!Manifesting!!.

             <p>In general, Bazzi's Cosmic album screams space. On of  my favorite albums. Just by looking at the cover art and track titles, you can already sense the vibe. This was an album I frequently listened to in middle school, so I guess I have always been attracted to this kind of sound. Dreams specifically starts of strong with the lyrics "A place, where space and time doesn’t exist...just us". So simple, yet a great intro. There is this run of an instrument throughout the song paired with a bass guitar that I really enjoy. His voice is so… (insert lip bite emoji LMAO).  </p>
         </div>
         <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> I was actually struggling to decide which song from this album I wanted to include. Some honorable mentions are ‘Changed’ and ‘Fantasy’, absolute bangers and I recommend. Looking back at it now, this album is decently sexual and I wonder if younger me really registered that upon first listening. If so…thats kinda crazy lol. It weird to think about how our perspectives shift as we get older. Even when it comes to music. I do not remember my initial reactions to this album. I obviously liked it, but now for the same reasons that I have now.
