    <h1>Music into Emotions</h1>
       <h2><u>Intro</u></h2>
       <p> This week I found myself faltering a bit with my confidence. Could it be the pressures of society, me being hard on myself, or my menstrual cycle taking a toll on my hormones (major TMI). Nonetheless, music is a form of escapism, as well as a tool to dictate your emotions</p>
     <p>First step was to figure out how I can use music to control my emotions. I could either dwell on my low self-esteem, or hype myself up enough for a confidence boost. </p>
       <h2><u>Song 1: Neva Play</u></h2>
       <p> The fast tempo of rap immediatley triggers the adrenlaine. Despite being flooded by my own thoughts, lyrics override my own thoughts and allows me to drown in its meaning and purpose.Rather than moping around, I find being productive a good way to stay busy and out of my head. </p>
       <p> Rappers are passionate about their craft because they see it as a way to artistically get their own thought out tha tend to be universal and relatble to listeners like myself.</p>

       <h2><u>Song 2: Buttons</u></h2>
       <p> Theres something about girl groups from the 2000's that makes me feel like I am the main character. The nostalgia itself eases my mind and takes me back to my youth (as if im not still young) </p>
       <p> What I consider a "successful" hype song is the songs ability to make listeners want to get up and dance. </p>

       <h2><u>Song 3: New Woman</u></h2>
       <p> "Revving up my au-au-au-au-aura, focus on my mind, taking my time, Im a new woman" Been going through the phase of self relfection and found comfort in the lyrics/song. It felt almost uplifting to be reminded once again abot the human experience. </p>
       <p> As I get older, I learn to appreciate each stage of my life, understanding that I need to experience these phases in order to grow and become the best version of myself.Realistically, facing hardship is inevitable and the only way to overcome such an obstacle is through your mindset. .  </p>

       <h2><u>Song 4: Touch</u></h2>
       <p>Another girl group song thats fresh off their debut. An earworm that refuses to go away even after listening to it on repeat. I catch my sisters and I humming along to the chorus of this song at random parts of the days more than we would like to admit, embarassing to sau the least. Songs that get stuck in my head can take about 10-12 business days to later be replaces with a new song. </p>

       <h2><u>Song 5: Girl so confusing</u></h2>
       <p> Charli XCX has been trending lately with her new album BRAT, and usually im not into songs that you would hear on tik tok, but I cannot deny the catchy vibe she brings to the table. Iornically enough, the song makes me feel like I can let lose, similarly to being in a club, even though I am not a fan of parties/clubs. A song that makes me want to shake my head and really feel the lyrics. A form of distraction, minus the sweaty bodies and smell of alcohol from a real party.</p>
