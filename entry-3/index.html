         <p>Charli XCX has been trending lately with her new album BRAT, and usually I am not into songs that you would hear on Tik Tok, but I cannot deny the catchy vibe she brings to the table. Ironically enough, the song makes me feel like I can go insane, similarly to being in a club, even though I am not a fan of parties/clubs. A song that makes me want to shake my head and really feel the lyrics…minus the sweaty bodies and smell of alcohol from a real party… gross. And the lyrics are so relatable for girl hood. Overthinking and misreading every interaction. Truly one of the biggest things that stresses me out: miscommunication. Out of nature, we love to assume. </p>
   </div>
      <div class="paragraph2">
       <p>Unrelated but totally related, music from this album reminds me of the Roblox game Dress to Impress. I was on my Dress to Impress arc for a while, but then SCHOOl got in the way of course. Maybe it was a hyper fixation game, not sure. I remember sitting in my lecture at the beginning of the semester, and watching in awe as the students around me were involved in various rounds of dress to impress. Took everything in my to not ask for the code (realistically I would not have cause I’m shy lol). On the topic of Roblox, I am personally a big fan of natural disaster, I think she’s a classic.

   <div class="paragraph1">
       <p> Using music as a means to create a story and fantasy is a specialty for Melanie Martinez that I have been obsessed with for years. The way she has created this trilogy following alongside a character she created is what makes her craft so unique. As well as her sound that portrays an “innocent” facade with dark themes. In general, her content is relatable and holds emotional value for me.  And the VISUALS that go along are even crazier. She truly is more than just a singers and i appreciate performers like that who clearly show how much they love what they do. Her short film for K-12 was a masterpiece fr. I think artists should do that more, films based of their albums.
 </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> Her music reminds me of a grungy fairy, specifically her newest album at this time, portals. This album is a masterpiece and a movie within the tracks. When artists chronologically connect songs within their album, I am always left excited by the concepts, a continuation of this bigger story. It is also just so satisfying to hear one track kind of loop into the next…if that makes sense?Portals is also a tour I did NOT get to go to…. whatever, i don’t even care.  </p>

        <p>Beyonce Beyonce…Shakira Shakira. I LOVE Shakira. People that know me know I am a huge Shakira stan. Fun fact, I was in class and saw on twitter that Shakira was having a free concert in Time Square, so i was telling myself i had to go the second class ended. I kid you not, I was only a few blocks away when i decided to turn around and forget about because of the news about the guys who were going around punching women LMAOOO. Was upset and still upset now. A FREE concert to see Shakira… whatever I don’t even care.

       <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> Of course Beyonce also somehow made it into the songs recs, damn, queen fr. Omg this song is about cheating, can we talking about how diabolical it is to find out a hottie celeb LIKE SHAKIRA got cheated on by a speck of dust??? The audacity of certain men is unreal. How does one cheat on Shakira or Beyonce.  I remember seeing this music video when I was younger and it having a chokehold on me (I should not have been watching that, but here we are lol).

I am actually not a fan of slower songs, because I find it difficult to get hype to, obviously. I only play it i I am doing homework (right now actually) or if I need music to cry to :| Music just holds that much power and can really skew my mood. If done right, I will add a slow song to my playlist, and this is one of those songs done VERY right. Their voices blend together in such a soothing way. With the instrumentals??? The scene need to be just right, walking through Europe or something.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> I was very lucky to see Laufey in concert, even though I wasn’t well versed in her music. I can assure you though I became a fan when i walked out of the venue. Seeing an artist live is SO different in comparison to just listening to their songs on your phone. The voice carries itself, but hearing it live was so different. That’s what I love about concerts. The talent really slaps you in the face and has you question why you weren’t blessed with the musically inclined talent gene, awk :0

             <p> EEE this song takes me back to angsty middle school days. ‘Electra’ is such an underrated album and I am convinced it would have done numbers now. I feel that way about so much music and find it so unfair that certain success is not properly appreciated or celebrated on the scale they deserve. But then again, I am the type to get annoyed when one of my favorite artists become mainstream…you win some you lose some, SIGHHH whatever.  </p>

       <p> I cannot help but feel like a diva listening to this song. This or ‘When I grow up’ by the Pussycat dolls. Sometimes you need to embrace your inner bad bitch. Fake it till you make it. The same stupid advice they gave me in High School when they were teaching me how to give a proper presentation. BTW, my skills are still pretty mediocre. I am told that I look confident when I present when I can assure you I am internally exploding. Guess the saying worked LMAO (insert straight face). </p>
