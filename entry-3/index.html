    <h1>Music into emotions</h1>
       <h2>Intro</h2>
       <p> This week I found myself faltering a bit with my confidence. Could it be the pressures of society, me being hard on myself, or my mentrual cycle taking a toll on my hormones (major TMI). Nonetheless, music is a form of escapism, as well as a tool to dictate your emotions</p>
       <p>First step was to figure out how I can use music to control my emotions. I could either dwell on my low self-esteem, or hype myself up enough for a confidence boost. I narrowed the vibe down to either badass or soft. Heres how and why.</p>
       <h2>Option 1: Badass</h2>
       <p> The fast tempo of rap immediatley triggers the adrenlaine. Despite being flooded by my own thoughts, lyrics override my own thoughts and allows me to drown in its meaning and purpose.</p>
       <p> Rappers are passionate about their craft because they see it as a way to artistically get their own thought out tha tend to be universal and relatble to listeners like myself.</p>
