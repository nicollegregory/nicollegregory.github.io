I do not think (well this is embarrassing to say) there was ever a time where i was not fan girling over something. It was like I needed something to look forward to. Boybands were my biggest weakness LOL.

         <p>CHASE ATLANTIC. That’s its… that’s the entry. Just kidding, but wow I would say they are in my top 3 artists. Their sound is just so cool and my middle school self would have been gagged at the fact that i finally was able to attend one of their concerts. Only took me a 3 hour drive to Philadelphia. Let me tell you… I am NOT a fan of philly. Could not even properly explain it to you but the vibes were off. Aside from that, the concert was PHENOMENAL. Normally I see fangirls cry on the internet and react with a “that crazy” kind of comment. But now that I have experienced that true fangirl shock… i get it. I stood there, with the lights dimmed low and the bass so loud that i felt it below my feet. Staring in awe. HEHE I need to see it again.  </p>
   </div>
      <div class="paragraph2">
       <p>I am almost embarrassed by my interest in f boy music. It is so not “feminism” but I can’t help it. The beat goes hard ok? and Christian??? I recorded all of his parts because i could not help myself. They were always my favorite part in the song and seeing it in person felt like an out of body experience (this is me being extra). Something i used to think about a lot was what do normal people do in their free time? This is vague, but hear me out. If you are not fangirling over something, what do you look forward to or what do you look at on social media. These kinda question had me curious about my older sister as i felt like she would never really fangirl over an artist the way i did.

       <p> One Direction was actually the inspiration for this weeks entry due to the tragic passing of one of the members. Like what do you mean a member of one direction died in MY life time… and at the ripe age of 19??? My sister and i were in her room chatting, she paused mid sentence and said liam died. Gagged. TRULY gagged. I was honestly getting flashbacks to the day Zayn left one direction and the internet went nuts. Sadly this was not the type of news I wanted at all. If it was not clear already, I was a huge fan of their music when i was younger and did not think the death of celebrity would have had me as confused as it did the past week. Update, it has a bit over a month later and he had his funeral, this is crazy yall.

       <p> I read about para-social relationships and never thought about it occurring unconsciously. A group of guys i don’t know personally somehow played a huge role in my upbringing, and this event allowed me to reflect on my childhood. I wonder if this is how it was when one of The Beatles died years ago. To lighten the moment, let me brag/flex real quick. I was lucky enough to have seen the mfs THREE times. Yup… yupppppp.  </p>

        <p>Kpop is a new tier of boy bands that holds so much negativity against them, it’s annoying. As mentioned in my SO LATINA entry, music holds no barriers and is a universal language. Not so sure why people oppose the idea of trying new things or hate the idea of fun. Nevertheless, BTS holds this boy band energy I longed for after my one direction phase.

       </div>
       <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> This song its off of my favorite album of theirs. “the most beautiful moment of life”. Something that is so attractive about BTS and Kpop in general is that it goes beyond the music. They are a performance group as well with their presence and impressive choreography. A very different concept from American acts. I was quite surprised experiencing a Kpop concert for the first time. I now find American concerts to be a bit underwhelming LOL. Similarly to house parties. Nothing beats a hispanic family party. The primos amongst primos and music playing all night to where the neighbors decide to call the police (true story, i can’t stand my neighbors)!!

Not to brag but I was in fact apart of that crowd back in 2014 that got to see 5 seconds of summer open for one direction. To be quite honest, i remember not even being a fan of them at the time, shame on 9 year old me. They were the grungy version of one direction was how i saw it when i was younger. Younger me was so judgmental about almost everything, which I cringe and laugh at now.  Life is much cooler the more open minded you approach it. If you are not willing to try new things out, how boring, but you do you boo.</p>

       <p> Luke Hemings has a lip piercing. I WANT A LIP PIERCING! Should I get one? I used to but then I took it out for stupid reasons, one of the only valid reasons being they literally pierced it wrong????? And not for nothing, but the lady who pierced it was rough too (insert sad face). I hope she counts her days fr because :[ Jk I do not even care anymore. But I want to get it correctly done. Im starting to feel like I am writing on a fangirl blog or something, just talking my shit.

             <p>I need more songs like this in my playlists actually. So if you have any recommendations please contact me on instagram, @/collesart (self promo ofc). I first heard this song from my cousin. Thought it was a bop, added it to my playlist. Does anyone else get the initial embarrassment of asking someone for the title of a song they introduce you to? Im starting to not care as much anymore, because If anything, I think the other person would appreciate the fact that you liked their song choice. When people ask me for recommendation I am immediately flattered. In general, society (including myself) needs to stop being embarrassed by normal events.  </p>

       <p> ‘Let’s Cheers To This’ is one of the few rock albums I have versed myself into. Omg or heavy metal, just thought about the genre right now in this moment. I do not think I could get into it but I am curious. Let me write this down. Anyways, Im just such a sucker for guitar and wish I had that rock influence from someone around me. It’s cool to think about the generational influence of music carried from our parents, to us, then to the future generations.
