       <div class="spacetext">
             <p> I really hate to admit, but boybands are my favorite kind of music. In general, bands tend to have a variety in their discography, considering there are various people working on their team and they usually each have so much to offer.
    </p>
      <p> I debated making this page must longer </p>

             <p> One Direction was actually the inspiration for this weeks entry due to the tragic passing of one of the members. It actually made me realize how powerful music is, and how deeply it can really touch another person. It‚Äôs a beautiful concept to think about actually.  Admittedly so, I was a huge fan of their music when i was younger and did not think the death of celebrity would‚Äôve had me as confused as it did the past week </p>
           <p>I read about parasocial relationships and never thought about it occurring unconsciously. A group of guys i don‚Äôt know personally somehow played a huge role in my upbringing, and this event allowed me to reflect on my childhood. I wonder if this is how it was when one of The Beatles died years ago. Never thought i would experience the death of a one direction member this early in my life :(</p>

        <div class="spacetext">
           <p> Kpop is a new tier of boy bands that holds so much negativity against them, it‚Äôs annoying. As mentioned in my SO LATINA entry, music holds no barriers and is a universal language. Not so sure why people oppose the idea of trying new things or hate the idea of fun. Nevertheless, BTS holds this boy band energy I longed for after my one direction phase. </p>
           <p> This song its off of my favorite album of theirs. ‚Äúthe most beautiful moment of life‚Äù. Something that is so attractive about bts and kpop in general is that it goes beyond the music. They are a performance group as well with their presence and impressive choreography. A very different concept from american acts. I was quite surprised experiencing a kpop concert for the first time. I now find american concerts to be a bit underwhelming LOL. </p>

       <div class="spacetext">
            <p>This song reminds me of both middle school and high school. Middle school is that cringy stage of your life when you really have no clue about your identity, what you like, what vibe you want to have etc. Because of this, I felt myself at a very young age wanting to try everything (I haven‚Äôt changed much from this loll) . Anyways‚Ä¶ Music from weezer was definitely me broadening my taste in music, as the radio was not doing it for me, listening to the same thing on repeat. </p>
           <p> Their sound is so rock and gives me memories of my art classes in high school, your typical high school art teachers. It is crazy to think about music as a form of identity, even for the listeners. At least for me, music is a huge routine for me. I guess it got to a point that </p>

    CHASE ATLANTIC. That‚Äôs its‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the entry. Just kidding, but wow I would say they are in my top 3 artists. Their sound is just so cool and my middle school self will be so proud to know that I am attending one of their concerts soon (hell yea). I think the most attractive think about their music is their voices, as well as the use of a saxophone.</p>
           <p> The instrumental is just as important as vocals. I use instrumentals to grind out work, especially when it has to be completed before midnight and i choose to procrastinate. Cassie in general feels so emotional. Makes me wonder why no one has written a song with my name (SIGH).</p>

                 <p> Could not talk about boy bands with mentioning the beatles, one of the greatest bands of all time. Listening back at their discography, they were definitely ahead of their time, no wonder they were a huge hit. </p>
           <p> Nothing pisses me off more than the term ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù in the music world. There are artists that I myself think to be overplayed, but I wouldn‚Äôt dismiss their hard work just because I am not a fan of it. This term can be seen on all the popular heartthrob bands mentioned in this entry. Just because they weren‚Äôt someone‚Äôs favorite, doesn‚Äôt mean they did not change the industry.</p>
