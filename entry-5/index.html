         <p> ‚ÄúSo Latina‚Äù is a real playlist that exists on my phone, and as a Latina myself, thought it would only be right to have an entry about it :) Im a huge fan of music, and only limiting my taste to your main stream english pop is so boring. 
</p>
  <p>It‚Äôs mind boggling to me when an audience has this idea of ‚Äúoh i can‚Äôt understand it hat they‚Äôre saying so why would i listen to it‚Äù. Lyrics obvious play a huge role, but sound and a beat are just as important. Music is a universal language used to express emotions and experiences. Why let language be a barrier? </p>

 <div class="spacetext">
         <p> Kali Uchis is one of my favorite artists, mainly because of her voice and style. It‚Äôs so feminine yet so strong. This song in general is so "girl", a common phrase you here nowadays in this generation lol. </p>
       <p> The idea of woman empowerment is a concept I feel strongly about. It is important to recognize the power of women and their potential. Songs with a message, as well as a catchy beat are the ones I emotionally attach myself with.</p>

       <p> The first thing that comes to mind when I here this song is the choreography in Just Dance. An iconic game of my child hood that I assure you I can still win at (not to toot my own horn of course). The nostalgia and memories rooted in music is what makes it all more enjoyable. </p>
       <p> There are many songs that remind me of certain points of my life, or I associate with a specific memory/person. Aside from me loving Rosalias voice, latin music has always been comforting and upbeat for me. I grew up surrounded by it, and continue to listen and discover. </p>

        <p>I remember hearing this song when I was younger and just recently came across it again and added it to my playlist. Becky g is an icon who has been making music for the longest, and her new tracks still hit so hard. </p>

              <p>
I LOVE shakira. People that know me know I am a shakira fan for sure. I remember my mom being obsessed with this song when it came out, so it‚Äôs a popular family car song when we all go out together to celebrate a special event and getting dinner! </p>
       <p> Latinas are commonly know for our awesome parties, so a party song like this will really get people like my mom going. That song that makes you wanna get up and dance, maybe even trying having hips that don‚Äôt lie like shakira. one can dream. </p>

     <div class="spacetext">
             <p> Karol G is a favorite in my family, eespecially her album <em>Manana sera Bonita</em>. She reminds me of the car rides with my sister, blasting the radio and taking in thee scenery. Hispanics are very family orientated, and value the connections with others.</p>
       <p> Similary to music, this form of art is an expressive way to connect with one another. Music can bind people together, whether it be over liking similar artists or genres, it is another form of communication. Being able to share something you enjoy or are passionate about with other people is refreshing, as well as heartwarming!</p>
