         <p>“So Latina” is a real playlist that exists on my phone, and as a Latina myself, thought it would only be right to have an entry about it :) Im a huge fan of music, and only limiting my taste to your main stream english pop is so boring. It’s mind boggling to me when an audience has this idea of “oh I can’t understand what they are saying so why would I listen to it”. Lyrics obvious play a huge role, but sound and a beat are just as important. Music is a universal language used to express emotions and experiences. Why let language be a barrier?

         <p>Kali Uchis is one of my favorite female artists, mainly because of her voice and style. It’s so feminine yet so strong. This song in general is so "girl", a common phrase you here nowadays in this generation lol. Im just a girl trying to make it through life with the help of music. Can you imagine life in silence?? Or can you imagine fi we lived in a world with constant background music. Not sure how that would work, but everyone own personal bubble has background music that only they could hear. Well, I guess that would just be like putting in one AirPod in…. LOLL.  </p>
   </div>
      <div class="paragraph2">
       <p>The ‘ORQUIDEAS’ album is a must listen to, highly recommend. The way she was able to blend English and spanish so seamlessly. I love hearing artists include their own culture in their music, whether it be through language or melody, instrumentals, etc. The idea of woman empowerment is a concept I feel strongly about. It is important to recognize the power of women and their potential. Songs with a message, as well as a catchy beat are the ones I tend to emotionally attach myself with.

       <p> Um shoutout to my older sister I guess for this song making it into the list. Her newest obsession: Raw Alejandro. I do not blame her at all actually, hence how we got her to this song recommendation. Took a listen to the ‘Cost Nuestra’ album and I really get it. Did my basic research, he can dance and his fine asf too??? Something about the instrumental in this song is tickling my brain. My sister was surprised that I liked this one a lot out of the entire album.

       <p> Im just recently getting into rap. And by that I mean I am able to sit through a car ride with my sister playing her music. Even though her taste has changed throughout the years, and dare I say, has gotten a lot better. I think I am fairly selective with my rap. I prefer female rap in terms of content/ lyrics. I am no saint and will bop to some of the most misogynistic lyrics known to man, it’s really inevitable LOLLL. Cannot help it though, the beat is going too hard. </p>

That was my first time being drunk as a concert, would not recommend! jk, if you’re responsible with the amount that you drink prior to the concert you will be ok. The prices of food, drink, or honestly anything in a concert is diabolical. Why are they charging me like ten dollars for a bottle of water. This was the origin to my upset tummy problem from pregaming to avoid paying for an expensive ass drink…whatever.

       <p> Im going to use Maluma being Colombian as a way to rant. You know what Guatemala is right? This is not a trick question lol. When I was younger and was asked the questions “what’s your ethnicity?” or “where are your parents from?”, a similar response was always given after I gave my answer. “wheres that lol” (insert crying emoji bro). Guatemala is a country in Central America shawtys. The food is bussin’.

Karol G is a favorite in my family, especially her album Mañana sera Bonita. If my sisters and I are home alone and get the opportunity to blast some music int he house, we typically tell Alexa to play Karol G. Her songs have lately been included in the family car rides to dinner or some other event. Its cute. This form of art is an expressive way to connect with one another. Music can bind people together, whether it be over liking similar artists or genres, it is another form of communication. Being able to share something you enjoy or are passionate about with other people is refreshing, as well as heartwarming!</p>

       <p> We also love to see another Colombian baddie on the rise. Let this be a warning if you cannot speak spanish, do not translate the lyrics lol. Some of these songs be crazy with it (insert skull emoji). Kinda awkward for a family car ride? But let’s just listen to it and not really process what is being said. I still find it difficult to ignore playing certain songs around my mom, Im never sure how aware she is when listening to music.

             <p>Max volume is the only right way to listen to this song, you’re not doing it right otherwise. My dad hates bad bunny, but I dont care that much and continue to play this song, so does my sister… and my mom actually. I be hearing her sing this song around the house, a massive ear worm. Now thinking about it, this song comes up in my head quite frequently, and it’s been like this for a while. I heard that the only was to get a song out of your head is by listening to the full thing instead of humming the one section you’re thinking about on loop. </p>

       <p> Let me tell you, you have not been to a party til you have attended a Hispanic party. We are commonly known for having awesome parties, so a party song like this will really get people like my mom going. This would probably also have my first in line on the dance floor. And NO it is not because of the lyrics…smh. The type of song that makes you want to get up and, I am trying to think of a PG or more appropriate way to say “shake ass” LMAOO. Best way to explain the vibes of this song in all honesty.
