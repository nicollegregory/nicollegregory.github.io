         <p>I will start of by saying I do not think i was born in the wrong time period. Normally that’s what you hear from an individual who strictly restrains themselves from listening to anything outside of tunes from the 80’s. Music has been around for thousands of years, why would I not want a taste of it all? This weeks entry we shall go back to pre Nicolle times (songs from before 2005 I guess). These are always a hit around the adults and some of the very few times they actually enjoy the music being played.

         <p> This song reminds me of both middle school and high school. Middle school is that cringy stage of your life when you really have no clue about your identity, what you like, what vibe you want to be etc. I find music so be a sense of identity in itself, it says a lot about a person, Except country, I hate to be that bitch but how do you genuinely get down to country. What is the energy at a country concert. How do you dance or get hype to that, not sure and i don’t necessarily want to find out. You should definitely try things out before claiming you don’t like it, but trust me… I have given country too many chances and i still remain, both disappointed and confused. (GOOD country recs only please). </p>
   </div>
      <div class="paragraph2">
       <p>Anyways, because of this self identity crisis, I felt myself at a very young age wanting to try everything (I haven’t changed much from this loll) . There is so much to try and discover in the world. How am I going to do it all? Music from Weezer, at the time, was definitely me broadening my taste in music. Their sound is so rock and gives me memories of my art classes in high school, your typical high school art teachers. The radio was not doing that for me, looping the same 5 pops songs through our the day with a constant intervention from INSUFFERABLE ads.   It is crazy to think about music as a form of identity, even for the listeners. At least for me, music is a huge routine for me. </p>

       <p> Could not talk about boy bands with mentioning the Beatles, one of the greatest boy bands of all time. Listening back at their discography, they were definitely ahead of their time, no wonder they were a huge hit. I remember in middle school being amazed by the audio quality. Spatial audio has become quite popular on apple music, the tracks being produced in a way where the listener can feel immersed into the song, like an unperson concert. Specifically in this track, you can hear John Lennon on one side of my ear and Paul McCartney in the other. Very awesome.

       <p> Nothing pisses me off more than the term “overrated” in the music world. There are artists that I myself think to be overplayed, but I wouldn’t dismiss their hard work just because I am not a fan of it. This term can be seen on all the popular heartthrobs artists nowadays. Just because they were not someone’s favorite, does not mean they did not change the industry or played a valuable role in the industry. And that is the problem with explosive media and the rise of technology. They love to shove celebrity news down your throat, when in reality, NO ONE CARES!! If I want to follow alongside a specific artist, I will do just that through my own  will. Plus, people are too opinionated these days (me included). </p>

        <p>Ironically enough, I found this song because of one direction (LOL). I love the boyband homage that groups do for artists before them. I have already mentioned my love for guitar. It’s just so cool, as simple as that. Simple instrumental is always a hit, surprisingly enough. They’re catchy and easy to remember.  </p>
       </div>
       <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> Yes i’m that bitch but that will hum along with the guitar, how can I not (especially in this song). Or playing air guitar in the middle of the living room. Picture it.  That’s how I spend my times listening to teenage dirtbag.  Never miss a beat. Or your typic in the shower at home concert. This is the human experience, with everyone living in their own fantasies. Sorry mom for using up the hot water, had to give the fans that encore. </p>

The king of pop. Michael Jackson always had such electrifying performances, what a badass. AND THE GUITAR??? you already know how i feel about it… anyways, the emotional effects of music show just how much of an experience something as simple as listening to music is. If you could bring back any artist from the dead to watch them in concert who would it be? My basic response would in fact be Michael Jackson. Not even for thee singing, but the performance. The way he glides across the stage with his moves is captivating and sounds like an experience everyone needs to have (or me at least).  </p>
       </div>
       <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> Speaking of michael Jackson, the conspiracies of pop culture have gone CRAY Z lately. I had a phase in middle school where I was heavily investing in conspiracy theories of the world (let it be known i’ll still watch a video essay here and there). We are currently experiencing blaming Beyoncé for, well, any pop star downfall moment LOL. Do not ever forget to thank her would be the synopsis of pop culture in 2024.

             <p> Im a bit shocked I liked this song… because it’s 10 minutes long. Granted I love music, and prefer longer songs. 2 minutes songs should NOT be allowed, it is not enough time.  Because how are you going to make a bop and only let me enjoy for 120 seconds??? Criminal. That’s not a song, that’s a sample… do better. Shorter songs are trendy for a reason I don’t understand. I am assuming the objective is for it to stream heavily on short content platform like Tik Tok or Instagram, but I DO NOT CARE!!! Give me a song, not a Tik Tok audio :///</p>
         </div>
         <div class="paragraph2">
       <p> I find myself listening to this song when I’m working on school, art, etc. The song mostly consists of guitar and instrumental, a simple beat as well! A lot of people mention how difficult it is for them to listen to music with lyrics when doing work. Fun fact: I need music to read lol. This gains an interesting reaction from others. Not sure if this is a curse or a blessing. Now by default, I am required to listen to music more frequently than the average person in order to efficiently do my work. But since this is not “average person behavior”, it can be looked down upon or not allowed… DUMB AS HECK!! If you see me listening to music with shitty grades, then do not allow me to listen to music, but if I am doing just fine, I do not see any issue. And thats my stance (insert nail emoji). </p>
