        <title> Music and Emotions </title>
        <h1> Philosophical Approaches </h1>
        <h2> Appereance Emotionalism </h2>
        <p1> Music expresses emotion without feeling it. Stephen Davies was the first to claim that "music is expressive of emotions in virtue of displaying emotion characteristics in appearance." Associations between musical features and emotion differ among individuals. Appearance emotionalism claims many listeners' perceiving associations constitutes the expressiveness of music. Which musical features are more commonly associated with which emotions is part of music psychology.</p1>

       <h1> Conveying Emotion through Music </h1>
       <h2> Structural Features</h2>
       <p1> Structural features are divided into two parts, segmental features and suprasegmental features. Segmental features are the individual sounds or tones that make up the music; this includes acoustic structures such as duration, amplitude, and pitch.</p1>

            Tempo: Fast tempo: excitement, anger. Slow tempo: sadness, serenity.
            Mode: Major tonality: happiness, joy. Minor tonality: sadness.
            Loudness: Intensity, power, or anger
